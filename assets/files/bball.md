### transitivity in NBA games 

(with Tianyi Li)

We are looking at how transitive is the competitive relationship between different NBA teams over time. By transitivity we mean if team A beats team B most of the time, and team B beats team C most of the time, is it true that team A beats team C most of the time? To put it another way, is there a clear hierarchy (more transitive) among teams or it's more like a rock-paper-scissors type of power dynamics (less transitive)? We do so by searching for a [Feedback Vertex Set (FVS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set) of the competition graph. Some results coming soon.
