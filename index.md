<!--My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. Iâ€™m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles. 
(e.g., video, text, map and network)
My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions such as advertising, pricing and targeting by developing algorithmic products that turn big unstructured data into actionable insights.
